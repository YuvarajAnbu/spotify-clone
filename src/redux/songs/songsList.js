    lyrics: `[00:09.29]Ah, ah.
          [00:19.29]We come from the land of the ice and snow,
          [00:20.80]From the midnight sun where the hot springs flow.
          [00:24.55]Hammer of the gods will drive our ships to new land.
          [00:31.81]To fight the hordes and sing, and cry.
          [00:35.80]Valhalla, I am coming.
          [00:44.56]Always sweep with, with threshing oar.
          [00:49.05]Our only goal will be the western shore.
          [00:57.06]Ah, ah.
          [01:05.80]We come from the land of the ice and snow,
          [01:07.55]From the midnight sun where the hot springs flow.
          [01:11.05]How soft your fields so green. Can whisper tales of gore.
          [01:18.30]Of how we calmed the tides of war. We are your overlords.
          [01:31.05]Always sweep with threshing oar,
          [01:35.30]Our only goal will be the western shore.
          [01:45.05]So now you'd better stop and rebuild all your ruins.
          [01:48.30]For peace and trust can win the day despite of all your losing.
          [01:56.32]Ooh. Ooh. Ooh. Ooh. Ooh

          [00:03.29]Last year didn't work out so well for me (fack, fack, fack) (fack last year)
          [00:08.02]2018, welp (fack, fack)
          [00:11.51]Yeah, I'm a fuckin' kamikaze crashin' into everything
          [00:14.76]You beat me, Islamic Nazi, that means there is no such thing
          [00:17.77]I've been goin' for your jugular since Craig G Duck Alert
          [00:20.78]Wedgie in my underwear, the whole bedsheet and the comforter
          [00:23.76]Stuck up in my rectal crack, kiss my disrespectful ass
          [00:26.75]I'll ride through your cul-de-sac
          [00:28.26]Window cracked, bumpin' your reference tracks
          [00:29.76]You collab on a referent rap, I have never said his raps
          [00:32.76]Overstayed my welcome, stepped in crap and ruined your welcome mat
          [00:35.76]So spit that shit from the heart, you didn't write like you wrote it
          [00:38.77]While I tea-bagged the microphone 'cause I go nuts on it
          [00:41.53]Like a fighter jet lined with explosives that'll strike any moment
          [00:44.26]Headed right at opponents and I am the fucking pilot that flown it
          [00:47.26]I'm 'bout to
          [00:48.25]Smash into everyone, crash into everything
          [00:52.00]Back and I've just begun, fack 2017

          [01:10.28]I'm a Kamikaze, gonna
          [01:11.75]I turned to rap 'cause it made me feel tough when I wasn't
          [01:15.28]From the moment I heard rap was cussin', I was in
          [01:17.76]Which is why I identify with the guy
          [01:19.01]Who I was invented by, Dre's Frankenstein
          [01:20.51]Energized like a nine volt, ice cold
          [01:22.29]Like Snake Eyes, twice in a row on a dice roll
          [01:24.00]But if the only reason I blow is 'cause I'm white though
          [01:26.51]Why don't every other white rapper sell what I sold? (ooh)
          [01:29.27]Kamikaze pilot, I wrote my suicide note
          [01:31.26]Here come the guys in white coats tryin' to stop me
          [01:34.01]'Fore I jump behind the controls and try to fly into foes

          [02:17.01]I heard your freestyle on Shade 45, that shit was embarrassing
          [02:20.01]There is no way we ever hear that shit again, I guarantee
          [02:22.76]That way, that shit was so ass, it's something we wouldn't dare re-air it

          [02:39.51]Serial killin' every beat there is, but wait
          [02:42.28]Wait, got the eeriest feelin', somethin' evil is lurkin'
          [02:45.76]I'm no conspiracy theorist but somethin' here is a foot
          [02:49.26]Oh yeah, it's my dick
          [02:50.51]Get the measurin' stick (what?)
          [02:52.26]Twelve inches of wood
          [02:53.76]Wait, but I've been goin' for your jugular since Craig G Duck Alert
          [02:56.51]And I've come to pay respects 'cause if you sleep, you're fucked
          [02:59.26]Other words, you get laid to rest
          [03:01.27]And I hope your butt is hurt
          [03:03.01]Put me on a track, I go cray on it like a color book
          [03:06.00]You got some views, but you're still below me
          [03:09.01]Mine are higher, so when you compare our views, you get overlooked
          [03:12.52]And I don't say the hook unless I wrote the hook
          [03:15.27]And now I'm just freestylin' in the vocal booth
          [03:18.76]And you know I've always spoke the truth
          [03:21.51]You lyin' through your teeth so much, you broke a tooth
          [03:24.76]And it ain't somethin' I need a phone to do
          [03:27.26]When I say I can't wait 'til I get ahold of you
          [03:31.02]And I don't know what I'm s'posed to do
